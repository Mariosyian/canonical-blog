This is a take-home assessment for the Web Developer role at [Canonical](https://www.canonical.com).

This test was written with NodeJS for the back-end and ExpressJS for the front-end. NodeJS as it's the only server-side Javascript environment I know, and ExpressJS due to it's simple HTML templates which combines vanilla HTML and CSS usage, with the ability to creatie dynamic content in a component-like manner. This makes ExpressJS the perfect method for learning frameworks and front-to-back end communication, as well as also being my first introduction into server-side rendering. HTTP requests are handled by the [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) package due to its simple use of promises and is also what I've been using in my personal projects and I feel comfortable with.

For a full list of dependencies please consult the `package.json` file.
